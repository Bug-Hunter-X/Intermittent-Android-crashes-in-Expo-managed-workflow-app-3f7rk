# Expo Android Intermittent Crash Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in an Expo managed workflow application resulting in intermittent crashes on Android devices.  The crashes are difficult to reproduce and debug due to inconsistent error messages and lack of clear stack traces. The application functions normally for a period of time before failing.

## Bug Description
The application crashes randomly on Android devices.  Standard debugging techniques, including console logging and remote debugging, have not revealed the root cause. The app uses asynchronous operations and integrates with several third-party libraries, but the exact point of failure is unclear.

## Steps to Reproduce
The steps to reproduce this bug are not reliably consistent due to its intermittent nature.  The app may run for varying lengths of time before crashing.  More information may be required to provide definitive reproduction steps.

## Solution
The solution to this bug (if found) will be detailed in the `bugSolution.js` file.
