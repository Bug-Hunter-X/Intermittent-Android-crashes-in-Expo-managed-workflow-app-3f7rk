// Solution (if found):
// After extensive debugging and review of asynchronous operations and third-party libraries,
// it was discovered that an unhandled promise rejection within a specific asynchronous function
// was causing the application to crash intermittently.  The solution involved adding comprehensive
// error handling within the asynchronous function and utilizing a global error handler to catch
// any unhandled rejections.

// Example (Illustrative):
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  try {
    // Asynchronous operation
    const result = await someAsyncOperation();
    // ...further operations...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in myAsyncFunction:', error);
    // Handle error appropriately (e.g., display an error message)
  }
}

// Global error handler (using a library like 'react-native-global-error-handler')
// ... (Implementation depends on the chosen library) ...

//Additional improvements to reduce the occurence of similar issues in the future: 
//1. Ensure all asynchronous operations are handled with try...catch blocks.
//2. Utilize a global error handling mechanism to catch and log any unhandled rejections.
//3. Use a logging library to track critical operations and generate detailed logs for future debugging.
//4. If possible, include detailed stack traces in error logs for better debugging.
//5. Carefully review any third-party libraries for known issues or potential conflicts.
